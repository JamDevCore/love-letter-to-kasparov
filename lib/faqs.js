    question: 'What do I get when I buy?',
    answer: 'You receive a unique piece of digital art. This artwork is stored in a decentralised fasion on a global peer-to-peer netowrk (IPFS) and your ownership confirmed by an NFT (ERC721) you will receive on the Ethereum Bblockchain.'
  },
  {
    question: 'What is an NFT?',
    answer: 'Don\'t worry, you don\'t need to know what an NFT is to make this purchase, but for those interested NFTs provide an incredible way to enable verifable ownership of art assets. They also provide a means to help artists monetise their craft and sometimes maintain royalties.'
  }, {
    question: 'Do I need crypto to pay?',
    answer: 'No. You can pay via credit card, or via cryptocurrency (ETH). If paying by card, after the familiar steps of purchase, you will be asked for your email which will provide access to your digital asset via a "wallet" a place where digital assets can be stored. Its designed to be super simple, but feel free to reach out if you have any issues'
  }, {
    question: 'What utility does this NFT come with',
    answer: 'None. These NFTs are pieces of art. A nuanced collection which I hope you enjoy as much as I do. Download it and stored as your desktop background (like me!) or print it and frame it on the wall. Study the patterns and admire the structures all whilst keeping in mind the game and the people it represents, and the tumulteous emotions and thoughts running through there mind for every move'
